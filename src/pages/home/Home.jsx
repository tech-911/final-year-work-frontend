          Pipelines are crucial infrastructures for transporting valuable
          resources over vast distances. Yet, they face threats from
          environmental conditions, vandalism, and defects, which can lead to
          catastrophic consequences like leaks, environmental damage, and
          resource supply disruption. As such modern monitoring systems have
          emerged to address defects and threats detection in real-time. This
          paper presents an innovative external pipeline monitoring robot that
          is lightweight and cost-effective in monitoring pipelines. This
          research details the design, development, capabilities, and future
          directions of the pipeline robot. The results demonstrate successful
          implementation of the robot's chassis design, motor control system,
          and data acquisition capabilities. The robot executes remote motion
          control commands while continuously capturing pipeline surface images
          for defect analysis.
